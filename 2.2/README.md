Enhanced Code Components:

Error Management: The current code lacks comprehensive error handling. Incorporating mechanisms to manage potential exceptions during API calls, file operations, and other critical sections is essential.
Input Validation: The code assumes the validity of input like PubMed ID and amount. Implementing input validation checks can ensure that provided values adhere to the anticipated range or format.
Logging: Integrating logging statements at various points in the code can offer valuable insights for debugging and resolving issues.
