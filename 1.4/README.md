The code has been divided into two distinct files: webcrawler.py and main.py.
The primary functionality is contained within the Crawler class located in crawler.py.
Methods in the Crawler class now handle SSL and URL opening.
Lambda expressions have been substituted with conventional functions to enhance clarity.
The primary loop is now part of the crawl_site method within the Crawler class.
The execution of the script is initiated by executing main.py.
The constant url has been transformed into an instance variable of the Crawler class.
Collectively, these modifications enhance code structure, encapsulation, and ease of maintenance.
